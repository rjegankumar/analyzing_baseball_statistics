# Analyzing Baseball Statistics

![](proj_img.jpg)

[Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) is a database containing statistics of batting, pitching, fielding etc. compiled by Sean Lahman, a renowned journalist. I have used several Python modules like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn to explore and analyze this dataset, and ended up answering some questions I came up with.

## Files and folders

| File/ Folder name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Datasets](Datasets) | Folder containing the csv files with all of the baseball stats and info |
| [Analyzing Baseball Statistics.ipynb](Analyzing%20Baseball%20Statistics.ipynb) | Jupyter notebook containing all of the data and analysis |
| [environment.yml](environment.yml) | Conda environment YAML |

## Setup

- You must have [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed to run this code.
- Create a conda environment using [environment.yml](environment.yml) YAML file. More help on this can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html#use-environment-from-file).
